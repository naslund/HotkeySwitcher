Glossary
--------
HotkeySet:			A combination of an ID, a vocation (character class) and a name
					Those hotkeysets are what's being saved in the xml file
Config:				The actual file containing all the spells and whatnot,
					each config is named with the ID of the HotkeySet it represents 
					(something like 44.cfg)
Character Class:	Same thing as vocation, one of the fields in a HotkeySet
