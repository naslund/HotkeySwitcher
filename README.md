HotkeySwitcher
==============

HotkeySwitcher is an application that manages multiple sets of hotkeys for the MMORPG Tibia.
HotkeySwitcher is depricated as of Tibia version 10.55 (Sep 15, 2014), since that version added the ability
to have different hotkey sets directly in the client.

Requirements
--------------

You only need the executable to be able to run this application
The application relies on an XML file and a folder to keep configs,
but these are created if not found.

Functionality
--------------

* Adding/Editing/Deleting pairs of hotkeysets and configs
* Saving all hotkeysets to an XML file
* Saving all imported configs in a folder
* Update the active config (the one that tibia uses) with the click of a button
* Minimizing to system tray
* Only performing actions with files when Tibia is not running
